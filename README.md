## Introduction
As part of a planned upgrade for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a new subdetector TORCH (Time Of internally Reflected Cherenkov light) is to be added, combining timing information with DIRC-style reconstruction, aiming for a ToF resolution of 10â€“15 ps (per track). The detector is sensetive to incoming photons and is arranged in a grid format, it outputs a list of grid coordinates where photons were detected.

A current challenge is in reconstructing detected photons path data, it is a computationally costly process and the data flow is incredible (Xinclude data rates here from the 40Mhz streamX). All detections are currently reconstructed. However, once reconstructed the events are filtered down to those that correlated to a particular event, a large  proportion of the detected photons (Xquote average percentage of noise? or sig to noise ratioX) are noise from other collisions or the detector and electronic subsystem.

Our desire is to reduce the number of signals that require path reconstruction by using a neural network to detect the signal, only passing these points on to the reconstruction algorithm saving the computation time spent on reconstructing the noise signals only to throw them away. This is critical in the efficiency of the processing pipeline as the LHC moves into its high luminosity upgrade where data rates will be further increased.

The DEEPLCEAN3D project focuses on the processing of data once digitised by the TORCH detectors electronics, to retain readbaility of this document the specifics of the detector itself and the physical significance of the data is not discussed in detail here. As part of this project a full physical simulation of a single TORCH module in operation in LHCb was created to generate realistic training data. The simulation is hosted as a standalone repository [TORCHSIM repository](https://github.com/Adillwma/LHCb_TORCH_Simulation) which focuses specifically on the detector and the process that leads to the need for DEEPCLEAN3D. Check it out for a complete breakdown of the TORCH detector and its opperation in the context of the LHCb experiment if you wish to fully understand the workings of TORCH and how the patterns are genrated.

## Motivation / Background / Reconstruction:
To infer the hadrons ToF, the TORCH simulation previously relied upon reconstruction through on a Monte Carlo approach \cite{SIMULATION USED MC}, where many Cherenkov photons are simulated and propagated forward from track to photon detector plane for each particle hypothesis (pion/kaon/proton) to create a probability density function (PDF) \cite{bhasin2020torch} \cite{Jonas_Torch}. Recently a fully analytical PDF reconstruction has been demonstrated as a more efficient alternative to the Monte Carlo method \cite{Jonas_Torch}. The analytical method requires four main computation steps, the total number of iterations and time taken both scale linearly with the number of photons on the detector as demonstrated in fig \ref{fig:reconscale} based on the figures given in \cite{Jonas_Torch}. Whilst the analytical method has been demonstrated to outperform the Monte Carlo \cite{Jonas_Torch}, after the upgrades the LHCb detector is expected to produce up to 500 Tb of data per second, which will have to be processed in real time \cite{bediaga2018physics}.

Many of the detected photons are detector noise, not correlated to the hadron itself, and can be removed pre-reconstruction. this paper tries to answer how successfully this can be achieved. The three main criteria we set out are; decreasing the uncorrelated photons in the data, to not discard or degrade the true correlated photons x,y or ToF values and finally minimal introduction of false positives via processing artefacts that counteract the reduction in noise and could confuse the reconstruction algorithm.

## Techniques Developed
### 2D with embedded ToF
Initially the intention was to use a true 3D autoencoder using 3D convolutional layers to process the data as a 3 dimensional object with x, y and time dimensions. However it was soon found to be very computationally intensive. Using the true x, y dimensions of the detector array, 88 x 128 pixels, and a simplified number of time steps (100) gives 1,126,400 total pixels per 3D image, which results in our autoencoder having 9,341,179 trainable parameters each of which must have its gradient calculated every batch

<div align="center">

<img src="Images/3d22d.png" width=600>

*Left hand image shows one of the simulated crosses in the full three dimensions of x,y and time. The right-hand side shows the same cross image but using our 2D with embedded ToF method, that compresses the three dimensional data to two dimensions to speed up the processing.*

</div>

The solution that was found was to reduce the dimensionality of the input data by squashing the time dimension, leaving a 2D image in X,Y. To retain the time information, we turn the time dimension index of any hit into the value that goes into that x,y position in the 2D array. So instead of a 3D array that has zero values for in place of non hits and 1's for hits we now have a 2D array with 0's still encoding non hits and now values between 1 and 100 indicating a hit and the corresponding ToF. This has the effect of reducing the 1m+ total pixels to a more manageable 11,264 and the trainable parameters in the autoencoder to 1,248,251 (an 86.6% decrease over true 3D) which dramatically sped up the processing and training time of the network. 

This 2D with embedded ToF approach does introduce two major downsides. Due to the nature of the flattening process it is susceptible to occlusion of pixels, i.e if there is a noise point with the same x and y position as a signal point but a greater ToF value then it will be the value used in the embedded ToF rather than the signal value behind it. This is not a problem as long as the amount of noise is not too high. We expect around 30 signal points and 200 noise points distributed over the 11,264 pixels in the squashed 2D image. The probability of a significant portion of the signal being covered up is low, however future improvement and a solution to this occlusion is proposed in section \ref{doublemaskmethod}. 

The second issue arising from the 2D with embedded ToF is due to the way the hits are now encoded. The input to the neural network has to be normalised to between 0 and 1. In the true 3D network where encoding hits as 0's or 1's there is a clear delineation to the loss function between the two cases. In the 2D embedded method the embedded hits values range from 0 to 100 and after normalisation the ToF values end up ranging from $0 < ToF \leq 1$. This creates a situation where very low ToF values are closer to being 'non-hits' than high ToF values in the eyes of the loss function. The loss function is incentivised toward good reconstruction of high ToF part of a signal. To mitigate this we introduced a method to reinforce the distinction between the non hits and the low ToF value hits we call gaped normalisation. 

### Gaped Normalisation
A gaped normalisation scheme, eq. \ref{norm eq}, was implemented that aims to create additional separation between non hits and hits, which is especially relevant in the context of our 2D embedded method \ref{2DwToF}. Rather than the standard normalisation that scales an input range from $0-n$ uniformly to $0-1$, the gaped normalisation leaves zero values as zero and compresses non zero values to a range between $r$ and 1, where $r$ is a parameter called the reconstruction threshold ($r$ can take values between 0 and 1 but was found to work best set to 0.5) which results in the normalised data ranging from 0-1 but with the range $0 < x < r$ left empty. This creates a gap between the case of 0 (no hit) and $r$ (lowest ToF hit). The addition of the reconstruction threshold parameter allows the sensitivity of the network to this effect to be set during training.

$$ y = \begin{cases}\frac{(1-r)x}{t} + r & \text{if } 0 < x \leq t \\0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$


A corresponding re-normalisation function, eq.\ref{renorm eq}, was created that carries out the inverse of the gaped normalisation, and is used to transform the networks ToF output back to the original range pre-normalisation. Data values below the reconstruction threshold $r$ are set to 0, while values above the threshold are mapped to a range between 0 and the maximum ToF value $t$ based on their distance from the threshold, demonstrated in fig. \ref{fig:reconcuttoff}.

$$ y = \begin{cases}\frac{t(r-x)}{1-r} & \text{if } r < x \leq 1 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$


You can directly copy and paste these equations into your GitHub readme to display them correctly.

In equations \ref{norm eq} and \ref{renorm eq}, $x$ represents the input data that is being transformed, $t$ is the number of time steps (in this case 100) and $r$ is the reconstruction threshold.

![The histogram shows the ToF values for all the pixels in the networks raw output before re-normalisation. Values are between 0 and 1 which is shown on the x axis, the number of pixels in each bin are label on the top of each histogram bin. The red line indicates the reconstruction cutoff value, $r$, All points below this cutoff will be set to 0's in the re-normalisation and all points above it will be spread out into the range 1-100 to return the real ToF value.](images/recon cut.png)

### Adaptive Class Balanced MSE Loss
During development  the network often only returned when tested with popular loss functions such as MSE and MAE the autoencoder was able to recover the signal, if the data contained many images of only the one signal pattern, which as mentioned results in a very poorly generalisable model is not usefull, but did indicate to us that the network is capable of encoding the pattern. However once shifting and scaling of the cross pattern were introduced it was unable to learn it and began returning blank images. After some research and investigation the problem was found to be an effect known as class imbalance which is an issue that can arise where the interesting features are contained in the minority class \cite{chawla2002smote}. The input image contains 11,264 total pixels and around 230 of them are hits (signal and noise) leaving 98.2\% of pixels as non-hits. For the network, just guessing that all the pixels are non-hits yields a 98.2\% reconstruction loss and it can easily get stuck in this local minima.

Class imbalance most commonly appears in classification tasks such as recognising that an image is of a certain class, i.e. â€˜catâ€™, â€˜dog', etc. Classification networks often use cross entropy loss and there are specific modifications of it developed to combat class imbalance, such as focal loss \cite{lin2017focal}, LovÃ¡sz-Softmax\cite{berman2018lovasz} and class-balanced loss \cite{cui2019class}. We present a new similar method called 'Automatic Class Balanced MSE' (ACB-MSE) which instead, through simple modification of the MSE loss function, provides automatic class balancing for MSE loss with additional user adjustable weighting to further tune the networks response. The function relies on the knowledge of the indices for all hits and non-hits in the true label image, which are then compared to the values in the corresponding index's in the recovered image. The loss function is given by:

$$ \text{Loss} = A(\frac{1}{N _ h}\sum _ {i = 1} ^ {N _ h}(y _ i - \hat{y} _ i) ^ 2) + B(\frac{1}{N _ n}\sum _ {i = 1} ^ {N _ n}(y _ i - \hat{y} _ i) ^ 2) $$

where $y_i$ is the true value of the $i$-th pixel in the class, $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted value of the $i$-th pixel in the class, and $n$ is the total number of pixels in the class (in our case labeled as $N_h$ and $N_n$ corresponding to 'hits' and 'no hits' classes, but can be extended to n classes). This approach to the loss function calculation takes the mean square of each class separately, when summing the separate classes errors back together they are automatically scaled by the inverse of the class frequency, normalising the class balance to 1:1. The additional coefficients $A$ and $B$ allow the user to manually adjust the balance to fine tune the networks results.

![Figure that demonstrates how each of the loss functions (ACB-MSE, MSE and MAE) behave based on the number of hits in the true signal. Two dummy images were created, the first image contains some ToF values of 100 the second image is a replica of the first but only containing the Tof values in half of the number of pixels of the first image, this simulates a 50% signal recovery. to generate the plot the first image was filled in two pixel increments with the second image following at a constant 50% recovery, and at each iteration the loss functions are calculated for the pair of images. We can see how the MSE and MAE functions loss varies as the size of the signal is increased. Whereas the ACB-MSE loss stays constant regardless of the frequency of the signal class.](images/loss curve 1.png)

The loss functions response curve is demonstrated in fig \ref{fig:losscurves}. This show how the the ACB-MSE compares to vanilla MSE and also MAE. The addition of ACB balancing means that the separate classes (non hits and hits) are exactly balanced regardless of how large a proportion of the population they are. this means that by guessing all the pixels are non hits results in a loss of 50\% rather than 98.2\%, and to improve on this the network must begin to fill in signal pixels. This frees the network from the local minima of returning blank images and incentives it to put forward its best signal prediction. The addition of the ACB-MSE Loss finally resulted in networks that were able to recover and effectively denoise the input data. The resulting x,y position of the output pixels was measured to be very good and visually the networks were doing a good job of getting close to the right ToF, however, qualitative analysis revealed that the number of pixels with a true ToF value correctly returned was close to zero. To remedy this a novel technique was developed, referred to as 'masking'.

### Masking Technique

<div align="center">

<img src="Images/netpathmask.png" width=1000>

*Illustration of the masking technique developed, shown here for a simple 4x4 input image. The numbers in the centre of the squares indicate the pixel values. The colours just help to visualise these values. The blue arrow path is the standard path for the denosing autoencoder, the red path shows the additional masking steps. the green arrow shows where the mask is taken from the standard autoencoders output and cast over the masking paths input.*

</div>




In the traditional approach and what shall be referred to as the 'direct' method the final denoised output is obtained by taking a clean input image, adding noise to it to simulate the detector noise, then passing the noised image as input to the DC3D denoiser, which removes the majority of the noise points and produces the finished denoised image. Although the network produces good x, y reconstruction (demonstrated in section \ref{XXXX}RESULTS at 91\%), and visually the ToF reconstruction is improving to the point that the signal can be visually discerned when compared to the original as shown in fig \ref{FIGURE OF VUSAL TOF BAD DIRECT}, quantitative analysis reveals that the direct output of the network achieves on average 0\% accuracy at finding exact ToF values. To address this problem, we introduce a new technique called â€˜maskingâ€™.  

The 'masking' method introduces an additional step to the process. Instead of taking the output of the denoiser as the final image, this becomes the 'mask'. The mask is then used on the original noised input image using a process described by equation \ref{masking eq}. If the mask has a zero value in an index position then the noised input is set to zero in that same index which has the effect of removing the noise. If the mask has a non zero value in it then the value from the corresponding index from the noised input stays as it is, so hits return to having their correct ToF, uncorrupted by the network. An additional benefit of this method is that any additional false positive lit pixels caused by the denoising process will be in the mask and so allow the original value to pass untouched, but the original value in the noised array will be 0 as these points were created by the denoising and so the final output is also automatically cleaned of the majority of denoising artefacts. The two methods are illustrated in fig. \ref{fig:maskingmethod} which shows the direct path in blue arrows and the masking method steps in red.

The masking technique yields perfect ToF recovery for all true signal pixel found, raising ToF recovery from zero to matching the true pixel recovery rate. Computationally, the additional step of casting the mask on the input image to create the masked output is very small compared to the denoising step. To demonstrate this, we timed the two methods (direct denoising vs. denoising + masking) on 1000 test images. The lowest measured run-time for direct denoising was 108.94 ms, and for denoising + masking was 110.29 ms, roughly a 1.24\% increase.

$$ R = \begin{cases}I & \text{if } M > 0 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$

where $I$ is the input image pixel, $M$ is the corresponding pixel in the mask, and $R$ the pixel in the final output.

### Supervised Signal Enhancement
Development was focused on the fully filled out cross patterns with around 200 signal points in this early stage to create a strong proof of concept for the general approach. Feeling like this goal had been achieved the data generator was changed to resemble a more realistic scenario displaying only 30 signal points of the 200 along the cross. The AE developed to this point was not able to learn the sparse patterns.

<div align="center">

<img src="Images/preprocess.png" width=600>

*This series of images shows the degradation steps available to be introduced into the reconstructive learning path, each image is a step on from its left neighbour.*

</div>

Taking inspiration from the the ideas behind the DAE and how the network is fed idealised data as a label whist it has noised data presented to it, a new methodology was trialed. The input data was reverted to the fully filled 200 photon cross paths, and additional signal degradation methods were incorporated into the noising phase. The initial trial added a function to dropout lit pixels from the input at random till 30 remain, the network is therefore presented with inputs that contain 30 hits only but gets the full filled cross as the label to compute loss against. This works spectacularly well with the network able to accurately reconstruct the patterns from only 30 signal points whilst also still performing the denosing role. This method returns the full cross pattern rather than the specific photon hits that were in the spare input, however if the later is desired, then the masking method applied to this path results in just the spares photons that fall underneath it in the sparse input image.

<div align="center">

<img src="Images/rl.png" width=600>

*Demonstrating the culmination of the RAE with masking applied to a realistic proportion of 30 signal points and 200 noise points. When using the reconstructive method the direct denoiser output returns the full traced pattern paths which may or may not be of more value then the individual photon hit locations. If this is not the case then the masking method provides a perfect way to recover the exact signal hits only.*
</div>



<div align="center">

<img src="Images/3d best.png" width=600>

*The results of the RAE applied to the 30 signal and 200 noise points shown in reconstructed 3D. It is important to note that the masked output does not look like the input image because in the case of the reconstructive method the masking recovers only the true signal points incident on the detector not the full pattern, these points are the input image after it has been thinned out by the sparsity function.*

</div>



For a final experiment into the possibilities of this reconstructive methodology another degradation layer was Incorporated that adds a random x and y shift to each photon in the input signal modeled by a Gaussian distribution. This is to simulate the resolution limitations of a detector. The network is passed in as input an image with all the photon hits shifted and has the perfect image as its label data for loss calculation, this again shows to be a highly successful methodology and demonstrated an ability to produce a tighter output cross signal than the smeared input. This has possible application to all detectors and could be used to enhance the physical resolution of a detector through software.   

<div align="center">

<img src="Images/sdevrec.png" width=600>

*Image demonstrating the detector resolution recovery. This is not the main application for the program but is presented as an interesting possibility for future follow up.*
</div>

This takes us beyond the DAE to a new structure that could be thought of as a Reconstructive Autoencoder or RAE. Similar to a DAE it aims to learn the underlying pattern behind a noised set of data and then attempt to recreate the label target from the noised samples, but in addition to this the RAE can also reconstruct the signal from a degraded set of measurements. 

## The DC3D Pipeline

<div align="center">

<img src="Images/ov.png" width=1000>

*The DC3D pipeline.*

    1) The detector produces 100, 128 x 88 images these are compressed to a single 128 x 88 image using the 2D with embedded ToF technique.

    2) Detector Smearing, Signal Sparsity and Noise are added to the image.

    3) the image is normalised using the gaped normalisation method.

    4) the image is processed by the DC3D Autoencoder network, shown in more detail in section \ref{AEDEEP}.

    5) The output of the autoencoder produces the denoised image.

    6) if using the direct method this denoised image is the result and is passed to the re-normalisation in step 10.

    7) If using the masking method the input to the autoencoder is used as the input for masking.

    8) The autoencoders output is used as a mask on the input to recover the correct ToF values.

    9) If using the masking method the output of step 8 is the result and is passed to the re-normalisation in step 10.

    10) Performs the inverse of the gaped normalisation to recover the ToF values.

    11) performs the inverse of the 3D to 2D with embedded ToF to recover the 3D data.
