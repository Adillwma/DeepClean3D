[Unreleased]
* 	 (HEAD -> main) 2023-03-03 Cleanup [Adill Al-Ashgar]
* 	 2023-03-03 Created fast script to create mixed datasets from all the various data generators we have built including X, blank, hemispheres and soon to be the realistic gen too . tthe genrator allows easy user setting of parameters and creates dataset then automatically runs full integrity andtof distribution checks to make sure that datsets are correct at the point of generation to speed up the process of testing. also made sure that there is very strong user visual feedback of progress as can take a long time with large datasets [Adill Al-Ashgar]
* 	 2023-03-03 updated the integrity checking function to clean up the terminal printing formatting and to also return the test results. Also removed useless stats and added in min and max along with test results printed on the distributions. also added plot saving for the distribution plotting [Adill Al-Ashgar]
* 	 2023-03-03 updated the integrity checking function to clean up the terminal printing formatting and to also return the test results [Adill Al-Ashgar]
* 	 2023-03-03 Cleaned up terminal printing from the blank image gen to conform to the formatting of the Fast_Dataset_creator [Adill Al-Ashgar]
* 	 2023-03-03 created visual tester for datasets as having problem getting multi X working [Adill Al-Ashgar]
* 	 2023-03-03 Updated comb X gen to slightly simplify the arguments so can call from extern al script "Fast_Dataset_Creator". HAd to move the X sim and generator into one file so they can be called in one line. also fixed various bugs (the incorrect order of args for the sim call)  removed the 0 X condition by making sure the gen calls crosses+1 rather than crosses and simplified the rotation and shifting conditions. Original files are still as untouched in simp x folder renamed to include BACKUP in the title [Adill Al-Ashgar]
