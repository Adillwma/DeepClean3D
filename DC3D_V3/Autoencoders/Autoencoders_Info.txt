AE1 has 2 lin layers - 4800 --> 128 --> encoded_space_dim
AE2 has 3 lin layers - 4800 --> 1024 --> 128 --> encoded_space_dim
AE3 has 4 lin layers - 4800 --> 1024 --> 256 --> 128 --> encoded_space_dim
AE4 has 5 lin layers - 4800 --> 1024 --> 512 --> 256 --> 128 --> encoded_space_dim
AE5 has 6 lin layers - 4800 --> 2048 --> 1024 --> 512 --> 256 --> 128 --> encoded_space_dim


AE1_2 is same as AE1 but with Dropout layers added.
AE1_3 is same as AE1 but with Dropout layers added to just the decoder.


AE6?
AE7?

AE1_Protected is the same as AE1 but adds 10px of padding around all sides of the input images and then removes it after the network, this changes the first linear layer to size 7488
AE1_Protected2 is the same as AE1 but adds 4px of padding around all sides of the input images and then removes it after the network, this changes the first linear layer to size ~6500
AE1_Protected3 is the same as AE1 but adds one more linear layer and 4px of padding around all sides of the input images and then removes it after the network, this changes the first linear layer to size ~6500
