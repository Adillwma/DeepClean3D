        #Conv2d function takes arguments: (input channels, output channels, kernel size/receiptive field (), stride and padding. # here for more info on arguments https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/personal/ex18871_bristol_ac_uk/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc={109841d1-79cb-45c2-ac39-0fd24300c883}&action=edit&wd=target%28Code%20Companion.one%7C%2FUntitled%20Page%7C55b8dfad-d53c-4d8e-a2ef-de1376232896%2F%29&wdorigin=NavigationUrl
        
        #Input channels is 1 as the image is black and white so only has luminace values no rgb channels, 
        #Output channels which is the amount of seperate output tensors?????????, this defines the number of seperate kernals that will be run across image, all which produce thier own output arrays
        #The kernal size, is the size of the convolving layer. best visualised at the link above. Ours is set at is 3 so i guess a line of 3 pixels? it can be square ie give a tuple (x,x) but out data has been linearlised for some reason? NOTE: Kernal size can be even but is almost always an odd number to there is symetry round a central pixel
        #Stride is how far the kernal moves across each time, the default is across by one pixel a time untill end of line then back to start of line and down by a pixel, followed by the cycle of across etc again. 
        #    setting the stride to larger values makes it move across jumping pixels, i.e (1,3) the filter moves across by 3 pixels, and then back to begining of line and down by 1 pixel, this is used to downsample data, so that is why our stride is larger than default. 
        #Padding adds padding to the edges of the data array  before the convoloution filtering, the padding value are noramlly zero but can be made other things. this is normally used to mamke the input array same size as the output
        #Dilation (not used param) sets the spread of the kernal, by defualt it is one contigous block, dilation spreads it out. best visulaised in the link above

###Following section splits the training dataset into two, train_data (to be noised) and valid data (to use in eval)
m=len(train_dataset) #Just calculates length of train dataset, m is only used in the next line to decide the values of the split, (4/5 m) and (1/5 m)
train_data, val_data = random_split(train_dataset, [int(m-m*0.2), int(m*0.2)])    #random_split(data_to_split, [size of output1, size of output2]) just splits the train_dataset into two parts, 4/5 goes to train_data and 1/5 goes to val_data , validation?


###Following section for Dataloaders, they just pull a random sample of images from each of the datasets we now have, train_data, valid_data, and test_data. the batch size defines how many are taken from each set, shuffle argument shuffles them each time?? #!!!
